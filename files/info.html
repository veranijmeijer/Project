        <h4>General information</h4>
        <p>The social security system in The Netherlands is known to be very good. First I will explain the different kinds of benefits:</p>
        <h6>WAO</h6>
        <p>The WAO is a benefit for employees that are sick or handicapped for a longer period of time. The WAO only exists for people who received WAO before 29th of December 2006. On that day, the AOW was replaced by the WIA.</p>
        <h6>Wajong</h6>
        <p>The Wajong benefits are for people who are unable to work before they turn 17 and are still unable to work once they turn 18. This also applies for people who become unable to work between their 18th and 30th birthday, while still studying. The benefits are 75% of the statutory minimum wage.</p>
        <h6>WAZ</h6>
        <p>This was an obligated disability insurance for the self-employed between 1998 and 2004. It gave self-employed the right of an allowance of 70% of the statutory minimum wage when they would become unable to work.</p>
        <h6>WIA</h6>
        <p>
          The WIA is a Dutch law that came into effect on the 29th of December in 2006 as successor of the WAO. The WIA knows three classes of incapacity for work.<br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              IVA<br>
              The IVA is for people who are at least 80% incapable of working with little to no chance of recovery. The employee will receive 75% of his/her last earned salary.
            </li>
            <li>
              WGA<br>
              The WGA is for people who are more than 35% or less than 80% incapable of working, as well as people who are more than 80% incapable of working, but still have a large chance of recovery. The WGA consists of two phases:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The wage-related benefit<br>
                  This if for people who have worked at least 26 weeks of the past 36 weeks. During the first two months they will receive 75% of their salary and after that 70% for the following duration of the benefits. The duration depends on their employment history.
                </li>
                <li> Two options:
                  <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                      The wage supplement allowance<br>
                      If someone does not meet the requirements of the wage-related benefit or has already used the wage-related benefit, they qualify for the wage supplement allowance. For example, someone who is for 50% unable to work, should still be able to earn half the salary they earned before getting sick or handicapped (their "earning capacity"). If someone is able to find a job that earns at least half of their earning capacity, they qualify for the wage supplement allowance. The wage supplement allowance is an amount of 70% of half their salary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The follow-up benefit<br>
                      Anyone that's not able to earn half of their earning capacity, will get a follow-up benefit. The amount they will get is determined individually.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h6>Werkloosheidsuitkering</h6>
        <p>The 'Werkloosheidsuitkering' is meant for people who are able to work and have worked enough (at least 26 of the past 36 weeks). The first two months they will receive 75% of their salary, after that 70%. The duration of the 'werkloosheidsuitkering' starts at three months, with a maximum of 38 months.</p>
        <h6>IOW</h6>
        <p>
          This law is meant for two kinds of eldery unemployed people, the IOW is 70% of the statutory minimum wage:
          <ul>
            <li>Eldery unemployed people, that after reaching the age of 60, no longer have rights for the 'werkloosheidsuitkering'.</li>
            <li>Eldery people who are unable to work, and no longer have the right to get the WGA benefits.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h6>Bijstand</h6>
        <p>This allowance is for people who are older than 18, earn less than a certain amount of money per year and don't have a lot of money. The amount of money single people receive is 70% of the statutory minimum wage. For maried people or people who live together, it is for two persons 100% of the statutory minimum wage.</p>
        <h6>IOAW</h6>
        <p>The 'IOAW' is an ending allowance, that only exists for people that were born before 1965. This allowance is meant for elderly unemployed people, that became unenployed after turning 50 and who have already used their right for 'werkloosheidsuitkering' or people who gained the rights for the WGA allowance after turning 50 and have already used their rights for WGA allowance. The amount of money they receive is 70% of the statutory minimum wage.</p>
        <h6>IOAZ</h6>
        <p>The 'IOAZ' allowance is meant for people who are self-employed and older than 55 years, whose income is not high enough and who therefore wants to quit. In 2019, the IOAZ is €1.291,18 per month for a single person.</p>
        <h6>AOW</h6>
        <p>The 'AOW' is the state pension. Every Dutch citizen will receive AOW once they turn 67 and 3 months. The height of the pension depends on how many years someone has lived in The Netherlands. For every year outside of The Netherlands, 2% of the pension is subtracted. In 2018 the amount a single person received was €15.021 per year.</p>
        <h6>ANW</h6>
        <p>The 'ANW' gives relatives an allowance after someone passed away. </p>
        <h6>AKW</h6>
        <p>
          The 'AKW' is also known as child benefits. This is a certain amount of money that parents receive per child that is younger than 18 years. It changes when the child grows older, the amounts are per 3 months:
